Leet Speak (1337 5p33|<)
==============================

**Firefox extension to convert all the text on a webpage to leet.**

Thus, after installation, the above line would look somewhat like this:

**pH1r3f0x 3X73N510n 70 K0NV3R7 4ll 73H 73x7 0n 4 w38p4g3 70 l337.**

I made this basically to get the hang of how extensions work in Firefox

I copied most of the code from the js behind [Jay's site](http://www.jayssite.com/stuff/l33t/l33t_translator.html)

Installation
-------------

- `git clone https://github.com/Gleek/leet-speak`
- Drag and drop leetspeak.xpi to your firefox window
- Click on install restart..done.
